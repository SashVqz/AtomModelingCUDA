This script sets up the necessary dependencies and builds a 3D particle simulation project.
 
It installs the following libraries:
    - GLEW (OpenGL Extension Wrangler Library) --> sudo apt-get install libglew-dev
    - GLFW (Graphics Library Framework) --> sudo apt-get install libglfw3-dev
    - GLM (OpenGL Mathematics) --> sudo apt-get install libglm-dev
    - CMake (build system generator) --> sudo apt-get install cmake

After installing the dependencies, it runs CMake to configure the project and then builds it using `make`.
Finally, it executes the resulting binary `ParticleSimulation3D`.
